### Debugging

This repository includes ready-to-use debug launch configurations under `.vscode/launch.json`.

Tip: If you need to debug only one module to save time, temporarily disable others in the YAML (`modules: { ... }`). The debug configuration just passes the config file; everything else is controlled by the YAML content.

Possible workflow:

1. Start an interactive session (container or env activated).
2. Open a VS Code tunnel (`code tunnel`), connect from your workstation.
3. Open the repository folder and use the provided debug configuration. No additional adapter setup required (uses `debugpy`). -> `F5` to start debugging.

Run tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Contributions welcome — keep changes chunk-aware (xarray/dask friendly) and small.

### Dev environment (linting & formatting)

This project uses Ruff for both linting and formatting, managed via an optional "dev" extra
and pre-commit hooks.

Install dev extra with uv:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

or with uv pip:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

#### Pre-commit hooks

Enable once (installs the Git hooks):

```bash
pre-commit install
```

and then run manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Naming conventions

- target: the ground-truth/reference dataset (e.g., ERA5). Public APIs now consistently use the parameter name `target`.
- prediction: the model outputs to be evaluated (e.g., ML). Public APIs now consistently use the parameter name `prediction`.
